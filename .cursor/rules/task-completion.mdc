# Task Completion

When given a task, **complete it fully** in the current session.

- **Never leave work for "next time"** – finish what you start
- **Never defer to others** – do not say "Antigravity will do X" or "this can be done later"
- **Implement end-to-end** – backend + frontend, all related files, tests if applicable
- **Verify it works** – run builds, fix errors, ensure integration is complete
- **Handle edge cases** – empty states, errors, auth checks as needed

If a task spans multiple features, complete all of them unless the user explicitly asks to pause or prioritize.
